# Pay Attention to the Keys: Visual Piano Transcription Using Transformers: Supplamentary Materials
Supplamentary materials to accompany the paper: Pay Attention to the Keys: Visual Piano Transcription Using Transformers.

## Google Colab
We provide a notebook on Google Colab which performs inference on a video from the R3s test dataset and saves the predictions to a MIDI and MP3 file.

## YouTube Playlist
We showcase a variety of predictions on both the R3s and PianoYT datasets.
For comparison on the R3s dataset we provide two versions of each video, one with predicted audio and another with the true audio.
Videos with predictions generated through our model are marked with "Predicted Notes", while videos using the true audio track are marked with "True Notes". 
For videos from the PianoYT dataset we provide a link to the original YouTube video in the description.
