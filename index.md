## Google Colab
We provide a notebook on Google Colab which performs inference on a video from the R3s test dataset and saves the predictions to a MIDI and MP3 file.

## YouTube Playlist
We showcase a variety of predictions on both the R3s and PianoYT datasets.
For comparison we provide two versions of each video, one with predicted audio and another with the true audio.
Videos with predictions generated through our model are marked with "Predicted Notes", while videos using the true audio track are marked with "True Notes".
